# BBCUserData

This is an analysis of traffic to the BBC website during the summer of 2016. I used some machine learning techniques to segment the audience into different types of users - sports fans, news fans, telly fans, and homepage searchers - and built up a profile of users for each group that outlines what they like to look at, when they look at it, and how.

All my findings are contained in 'DataReport.pdf'. I do not have permission to share the dataset and it isn't publicly available so the code in BBCfunctions.py unfortunately will not run without the dataset being contained in the same directory.
